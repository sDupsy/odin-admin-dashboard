# The Odin Project: Admin Dashboard

A responsive Admin Dashboard built with HTML and CSS Grid. Instead of placeholder content, it showcases my completed projects from The Odin Project, each linked to a live demo and GitHub repo.

## Features
- Responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Interactive hover effects
- Links to live previews and GitHub repos of past projects
- Easily extendable for new projects

##  Purpose
This project was built as part of my learning journey in The Odin Project.
It reflects my skills at that stage, and I plan to update and improve it as I grow.
